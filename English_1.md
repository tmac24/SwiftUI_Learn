Do you like drinking coffee?

No, I don't like drinking coffee.  I find the taste too strong and bitter for my liking.  Instead, I prefer to drink tea or fruit juices. They are more refreshing and better suited to my taste. Additionally, tea has a calming effect, which I enjoy, and it offers a variety of flavors that I find more appealing.

Are you a person who likes to stay at home?

Yes, I do enjoy staying at home. I find it a great place to relax and recharge. It's where I can pursue my hobbies, read a good book, or just enjoy some quiet time. However, I also value getting out and about to explore new places and meet new people, so I try to strike a balance between the two.

Language take away.

So our first word on our language take away is in a bit of a hurry, in a bit of a hurry, in a bit of a hurry, in a bit of a hurry. So Nick was in a hurry. Yeah, that's right. This is a great phrase. So let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase.
所以我们关于语言带走的第一个词是有点匆忙，有点匆忙，有点匆忙，有点匆忙。所以尼克很着急。是的，没错。这是一个很好的短语。因此，让我们听听三个示例，了解如何使用这个短语。

我现在不能说话，我有点着急。

Example 3.
示例 3.

I'm in a bit of a hurry so I'll check these files later.
我有点着急，所以稍后再检查这些文件。

OK, so it's clear now. Basically it means that you don't have time. You're moving really quickly. OK, perfect. Now let's look at our second language, take away word and its contact details. Contact details, contact details, contact details. So what are your contact details? Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card. All right, so we have like our name, our telephone number, your e-mail address.
好的，现在很清楚了。基本上这意味着你没有时间。你移动得非常快。好的，完美。现在让我们看看我们的第二语言，去掉单词及其联系方式。联系方式，联系方式，联系方式。那么你的联系方式是什么？基本上，这是您可以在名片上找到的信息。好的，我们有我们的名字、电话号码、您的电子邮件地址。

Yes, perhaps your mobile phone number. So all the useful information so people can get in touch with you. Yeah. So people can phone you or e-mail you. OK, so contact details. Great. OK, so our third word is slipped my mind. Slipped my mind. Slipped my mind. Slipped my mind. So this is a funny phrase. It's kind of strange, right? Yeah, Slipped my mind. It sounds very weird.
是的，也许是您的手机号码。因此，所有有用的信息都可以让人们与您取得联系。是的。因此，人们可以给您打电话或发电子邮件。好的，所以联系方式。伟大。好的，所以我们的第三个词让我忘记了。我忘记了。我忘记了。我忘记了。所以这是一个有趣的短语。这有点奇怪，对吧？是的，我忘记了。这听起来很奇怪。

Exactly. OK, so now we're going to listen to two examples.

Of this phrase. Try and see if you can figure out what it means.
这句话。试着看看你是否能弄清楚它的含义。

Example one.
示例一。

很抱歉我忘记回复您的电子邮件，我只是忘记了。

Example 2.
示例 2.

Don't you know what day it is today? Oh, it's your birthday? It completely slipped my mind.
你不知道今天是哪一天吗？哦，今天是你的生日？这完全忘记了我的脑海。

So slipped my mind is like I forgot. You forgot something so accidentally, right? OK, great. Now it's time for putting it together.
我的思绪就像忘记了一样。你这么不小心忘记了什么，对吧？好的，太好了。现在是时候把它放在一起了。

Putting it together.
把它放在一起。

All right, Erica, why don't you tell our listeners what putting it together is? Well, putting it together helps you put language together. It helps you be more fluent by knowing how words fit together. Great. So let's look at our first phrase today. And it's around here, around here, around here, around here. So this is like close by, close by, right? I can say, for example.
好吧，艾丽卡，你为什么不告诉我们的听众什么是组合在一起呢？好吧，把它们放在一起可以帮助你把语言放在一起。它通过了解单词如何组合在一起来帮助您更加流利。伟大。那么让我们看看我们今天的第一句话。就在这附近，就在这附近，就在这附近，就在这附近。所以这就像近在咫尺，近在咫尺，对吧？例如，我可以说。

Is there a bank around here? Yeah.
这附近有银行吗？是的。

So that's, is there a bank close to here? Exactly. Now this phrase around here, we can change it a little bit and it means something a little bit different, right? I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant right around the corner.
这就是，这里附近有银行吗？完全。现在这里的这个短语，我们可以稍微改变一下，它的含义有点不同，对吧？我可以说，马可，拐角处有一家很棒的餐厅。

Right. And that would mean there is a great restaurant on the other street. Yep. Around the corner. Great. Or we have another example we can say around there. Around there. Right. So for example, I can say Los Angeles is a great city. I used to live around there. So you used to live near Los Angeles? Exactly. All right. It's a really good phrase, and it's really common. Yeah. Now our next phrase in putting it together is terrible.
右。这意味着另一条街上有一家很棒的餐厅。是的。在拐角处。伟大。或者我们可以在那里说另一个例子。在那附近。右。例如，我可以说洛杉矶是一座伟大的城市。我曾经住在那里。所以你曾经住在洛杉矶附近？完全。好吧。这是一个非常好的短语，而且非常常见。是的。现在，我们把它放在一起的下一句话很糟糕。

Death terrible with, terrible with, terrible with. So we have a couple of examples that will show you how this phrase works.
死亡可怕，可怕，可怕。因此，我们有几个示例可以向您展示这个短语是如何工作的。

Example one.
示例一。

You're terrible with numbers. You can't even remember your own telephone number.
你对数字很糟糕。你甚至不记得自己的电话号码。

Example 2.
示例 2.

I'm terrible with directions. I'm always getting lost.
我对方向很糟糕。我总是迷路了。

Example 3.
示例 3.

I'm terrible with faces, I can never remember what people look like.
我的脸很糟糕，我永远不记得人们长什么样子。

Wow, I understand that. I'm also terrible with numbers. I can barely add 2 + 2. Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is a numbers person. I'm terrible with faces. I sometimes forget what people look like. Really. Yeah. So I think it's time now for us to listen to our dialogue a second time. OK, this time the dialogue will be a little bit slower, right? So try and listen for some of the words we've just talked about.
哇，我明白这一点。我对数字也很糟糕。我几乎无法添加 2 + 2。嗯，是的，我想不是每个人都是数字人。我对面孔很糟糕。我有时会忘记人们长什么样子。真。是的。所以我认为现在是我们第二次倾听对话的时候了。好，这次对话会慢一点吧？因此，请尝试听听我们刚才谈到的一些词。

Nick, how's it going? Oh, hey, what are you doing in this neighborhood? Do you live around here? Actually, my office is right around the corner. It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.
尼克，怎么样？哎呀，你在这附近干什么？你住在这附近吗？事实上，我的办公室就在拐角处。很高兴上周在会议上见到你。我真的很喜欢我们关于外国投资的谈话。

这真的很有趣。我有点着急，但这是我的卡片。我们绝对应该再次见面并继续讨论。

Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

You know what, this is really embarrassing but your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me?
你知道吗，这真的很尴尬，但你的名字刚刚从我的脑海中溜走。你能提醒我吗？

Sure. My name is Anna Faris.
确定。我叫安娜·法里斯。

Don't worry about it, happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names too.
别担心，我经常发生。我对名字也很糟糕。

So it's more clear now you can understand a lot better, right? Yeah, that's true. Great. So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.
所以现在你更清楚了，你可以更好地理解，对吧？是的，这是真的。伟大。所以现在是时候让我们看看 Fluency Builder 了。

Fluency Builder. So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases and show you how you can be more fluent or how you can sound more native. Yeah, great. In the beginning of the dialogue, Anna said, Nick, how's it going? Yeah, this is a great phrase. It sounds really, really natural. You know, sometimes I hear students say, how are you?
流畅度生成器。因此，使用 Fluency Builder，我们采用一些非常简单的短语，向您展示如何更流利或如何听起来更母语。是的，太好了。在对话的开始，安娜说，尼克，进展怎么样？是的，这是一个很棒的短语。这听起来非常非常自然。你知道，有时我听到学生说，你好吗？

Or how are you doing? Those are two great phrases but this.
或者你过得怎么样？这是两个很棒的短语，但这个。

One sounds really, really natural. It just sounds more casual. Yeah, let's listen again to that phrase from the dialogue.
一个听起来非常非常自然。只是听起来更随意。是的，让我们再听一遍对话中的那句话。

How's it going?
进展如何？

How's it going?
进展如何？

Great. So next time that you find a friend on the street, you can just say, hey, how's it going? Yeah. So Marco, have you ever forgotten someone's name? Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times. And actually the most embarrassing situation was that I forgot a family member's, no, a family member's name. We had like, a family reunion and there were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins that I hadn't seen in a while, and I just forgot one of my uncle's names. And that was. Oh.
伟大。所以下次你在街上找到朋友时，你可以说，嘿，怎么样？是的。那么马可，你有没有忘记过某人的名字？是的，这种情况发生在我身上几次。实际上，最尴尬的情况是我忘记了家庭成员的名字，不，是家庭成员的名字。我们举行了一次家庭聚会，有很多我已经有一段时间没有见面的阿姨、叔叔和表兄弟姐妹了，我只是忘记了我叔叔的一个名字。确实如此。哦。

It's pretty embarrassing. Yeah. So what did you do? Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins. I'm like, hey, who is that guy? He's like, oh, that's Uncle John. I'm like, oh, man, I totally forgot. Yeah. So it was really embarrassing because I didn't know what to call him. So I just called him Uncle because I didn't know his name. Hi, Uncle. Yeah. So when that happens to me, when I'm in a business setting, sometimes what I do is I ask for someone's card.
这很尴尬。是的。那你做了什么？好吧，我不得不问问我的另一个表兄弟。我想，嘿，那个人是谁？他就像，哦，那是约翰叔叔。我想，哦，伙计，我完全忘记了。是的。所以这真的很尴尬，因为我不知道该怎么称呼他。所以我就叫他叔叔，因为我不知道他的名字。嗨，叔叔。是的。因此，当这种情况发生在我身上时，当我在商业环境中时，有时我会做的是要某人的卡。

Yeah, that's the good technique. Yeah. Or sometimes I might ask them to write down their.
是的，这是很好的技术。是的。或者有时我可能会要求他们写下他们的。

E-mail because usually their full name is spelled out in their e-mail address. So that's my trick when I forgotten someones name. That's a good trick and I guess a lot of our listeners can take your advice on that.
电子邮件，因为通常他们的全名会在他们的电子邮件地址中拼写出来。所以这就是我忘记某人名字时的伎俩。这是一个很好的技巧，我想我们的很多听众都可以接受你的建议。

OK, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue one more time, this time at natural speed.
好的，所以我认为是时候让我们再听一次我们的对话了，这次是以自然的速度。

Nick, how's it going? Oh, hey, what are you doing in this neighborhood? Do you live around here? Actually, my office is right around the corner.
尼克，怎么样？哎呀，你在这附近干什么？你住在这附近吗？事实上，我的办公室就在拐角处。
